Majority of the afternoon was spent figuring out which idea to build for the ruby terminal app assessment. My initial idea was an cooking guide for steak. It would cover storage, cooking and different cuts. The main issue was that this may have limited scope to cover enough methods, classes, ruby gems, etc.

As a result, I started scoping an app where customer can order products from suppliers. Suppliers and customers would have different options when using the app.

The morning focused on documentation and project planning. Documentation that was created: 
- started README;
- flow chart for Suppliers; and 
- flow chart for Customers. 

During the flow chart creation process I mapped out:
- the users (i.e. Supplier and Customers);
- menu options for each type of user; 
- where the information displaying to the user crosses over between the two users; 
- classes; and 
- inputs required from users.

Trello boards were created which mapped out documentation to be completed, methods and classes. Labels indiciate level of difficulty.
