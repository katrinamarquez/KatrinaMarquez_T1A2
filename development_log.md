Majority of the afternoon was spent figuring out which idea to build for the ruby terminal app assessment. My initial idea was an cooking guide for steak. It would cover storage, cooking and different cuts. The main issue was that this may have limited scope to cover enough methods, classes, ruby gems, etc.

As a result, I started scoping an app where customer can order products from suppliers. Suppliers and customers would have different options when using the app.

The morning focused on documentation and project planning. Documentation that was created: 
- started README;
- flow chart for Suppliers; and 
- flow chart for Customers. 

During the flow chart creation process I mapped out:
- the users (i.e. Supplier and Customers);
- menu options for each type of user; 
- where the information displaying to the user crosses over between the two users; 
- classes; and 
- inputs required from users.

Trello boards were created which mapped out documentation to be completed, methods and classes. Labels indiciate level of difficulty.

Coding completed:
- Methods for when a customer is purchasing a product. This took a while as I wanted to show the total price of the order after adding an item to the order array.
- Resolved bugs that came about from coding yesterday. 

# 24/04/2020 
Coding completed:
- Added in colorize ruby gem. Make identifying parts of the text more obvious to the user in the terminal. 

Documentation completed: 
- User stories. It was ok to do this at this point during development as most of the user stories were mapped out in the flow chart. 
- (NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED): The order of the flow chart and what information is displayed has changed slightly, as a result of issues encountered when writing the methods.
