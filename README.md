## Problem
"Is there an app I can download?" is a common question asked when people are online shopping. If you are a home owner undertaking a home renovation project or you are a builder purchasing supplies for your site, you need an all-in-one solution that allows you to quickly see the price of goods and order products. Driving around to different stores and calling different suppliers is time heavy. 

SupplierMate was created to make it easier to:
- view items for sale;
- view the prices; and 
- order from the supplier.
We wanted to enable users to complete it in one solution. 

We provide a solution for both sides of the transaction:
- **suppliers** *are able to display products to prospective or recurring customers*; and
- **customers** *avoid the need to pick up the phone and call the supplier*.
